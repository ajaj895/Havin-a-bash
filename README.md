## USAGE

When using these bash scripts, you need to chmod the scripts so you can execute them. Use chmod 100 110 or 111 for the permissions depending on what user you are. 

To then run the program do the following in a command line:

./path/to/script/of/your/choice/scriptname

Some of these scripts will run forever, to escape from them, hit control and C at the same time to end the script.

## ABOUT

This is repository is an assortment of bash scripts I have been working on, for both class and personal projects. I will do my best at documenting what each one does either in code or in this readme.
